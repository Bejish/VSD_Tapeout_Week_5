**Week 5 Focus Area**: Floorplanning ‚Üí PDN ‚Üí Global Placement ‚Üí Detailed Placement

## üéØ **Stage 1: Floorplanning**

### **What is Floorplanning?**

Floorplanning establishes the physical foundation of your chip design:

- **Die Area**: Total silicon area including I/O pads
- **Core Area**: Usable area for standard cells and macros
- **I/O Placement**: Strategic positioning of input/output pins
- **Macro Placement**: Large block positioning (RAMs, ROMs, analog blocks)

### **Floorplan Execution**

**TCL Script: floor_floorplan.tcl**

Key commands executed:
```tcl
initialize_floorplan -site $site \
    -die_area $die_area \
    -core_area $core_area

place_pins -hor_layers $io_placer_hor_layer \
    -ver_layers $io_placer_ver_layer \
    -annealing -min_distance 4
```

**Running the Floorplan:**
```bash
openroad -gui -log gcd_logfile.log gcd_nangate45_copy.tcl
```

<p align="center">
   <img src="Images/week5_5.png" alt="Initial floorplan view showing die and core boundaries" width="90%">
</p>

*Initial floorplan visualization in OpenROAD GUI - die boundary (100.13 √ó 100.8 Œºm) and core area (80.18 √ó 79.8 Œºm) clearly defined with I/O pins placed on the periphery.*

---

<p align="center">
   <img src="Images/week5_6.png" alt="Floorplan with placement rows and tracks enabled" width="90%">
</p>

*Floorplan with placement rows (purple horizontal lines) and routing tracks (vertical/horizontal grid) enabled - shows the structured layout canvas where standard cells will be placed.*

---

### **Floorplan Analysis**

**Design Parameters:**
- **Die Area**: 100.13 √ó 100.8 Œºm¬≤ (total silicon)
- **Core Area**: 90.25 √ó 91.0 Œºm¬≤ (usable for placement)
- **Core Utilization**: ~80% of die area
- **I/O Configuration**: Pins distributed on all four sides
- **Placement Rows**: Horizontal rows for standard cell alignment

**Key Observations:**
- Clean separation between die and core boundaries
- Adequate I/O spacing (min 4 units) prevents routing congestion
- Row structure visible for future cell placement
- Tracks defined on multiple metal layers for routing

---

## ‚ö° **Stage 2: Power Distribution Network (PDN)**

### **What is PDN?**

The Power Distribution Network delivers stable VDD and VSS to all cells:

- **Power Rings**: Outer rings surrounding the core
- **Power Stripes**: Vertical/horizontal power rails
- **Standard Cell Rails**: Row-level power supply
- **Via Stacks**: Inter-layer power connections

### **PDN Generation**

**TCL Script: floor_pdn.tcl**

Key commands:
```tcl
source $pdn_cfg
pdngen
```

<p align="center">
   <img src="Images/week5_7.png" alt="Power distribution network showing VDD and VSS grids" width="90%">
</p>

*Complete Power Distribution Network visualization - both VDD (green) and VSS (red) grids overlaid, showing the comprehensive power delivery infrastructure across the entire core area.*

---

<p align="center">
   <img src="Images/week5_8.png" alt="Detailed placement result with non-overlapping cells" width="90%">
</p>

*Detailed placement completion - all standard cells legally placed in rows with no overlaps, color-coded by cell type (logic gates, flip-flops, buffers) showing optimized utilization and routability.*

---

### **PDN Analysis**

**Power Grid Structure:**
- **Horizontal Stripes**: VDD/VSS on metal layers 4-5
- **Vertical Stripes**: VDD/VSS on metal layers 4-5
- **Grid Spacing**: Optimized for IR drop and current delivery
- **Via Connections**: Multi-layer stack for low resistance

**Design Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Complete power coverage across core area
- ‚úÖ Uniform grid spacing for balanced current distribution
- ‚úÖ Proper VDD/VSS separation to prevent shorts
- ‚úÖ Connection to I/O power pads established

---

## üéØ **Stage 3: Global Placement**

### **What is Global Placement?**

Global placement performs initial cell positioning optimization:

- **Rough Positioning**: Cells placed approximately in optimal locations
- **Wirelength Optimization**: Minimizes total wire length
- **Density Control**: Distributes cells to avoid congestion
- **Overlap Allowed**: Cells may overlap (legalized later)

### **Global Placement Features**

**Key Optimizations:**
```tcl
global_placement -density $global_place_density \
    -pad_left $global_place_pad \
    -pad_right $global_place_pad \
    -skip_io

global_placement -routability_driven \
    -density $global_place_density \
    -pad_left $global_place_pad \
    -pad_right $global_place_pad
```

**Two-Phase Approach:**
1. **Initial Placement**: Skip I/O, focus on core cells
2. **Routability-Driven**: Incorporate routing congestion analysis

### **Global Placement Results**

**Characteristics:**
- **Cell Overlap**: Intentional overlapping for optimal wirelength
- **Density Maps**: Congestion hotspots identified
- **Timing-Aware**: Critical paths prioritized
- **Routability**: Congestion prediction guides placement

---

## üèÜ **Stage 4: Detailed Placement**

### **What is Detailed Placement?**

Detailed placement finalizes cell positions with legalization:

- **Legalization**: Remove all overlaps, snap to rows
- **Row Alignment**: Cells aligned to placement sites
- **Optimization**: Local adjustments for timing/area
- **DRC Clean**: Design rule compliant placement

### **Detailed Placement Execution**

**TCL Script: floor_detailed_placement.tcl**

Key commands:
```tcl
set_placement_padding -global -left $detail_place_pad -right $detail_place_pad
detailed_placement

# Timing analysis post-placement
report_worst_slack -min -digits 3
report_worst_slack -max -digits 3
report_tns -digits 3
```

### **Detailed Placement Results**

**Final Statistics:**
- **Total Cells Placed**: 5157 cells (gcd design)
- **Utilization**: ~85-90% of core area
- **Overlap**: Zero (all cells legally placed)
- **Timing**: Setup and hold slack reported
- **Design Rule Compliance**: 100% clean

**Quality Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ No overlapping cells
- ‚úÖ All cells on-grid and row-aligned
- ‚úÖ Optimized for routability
- ‚úÖ Timing constraints considered
- ‚úÖ Ready for clock tree synthesis
